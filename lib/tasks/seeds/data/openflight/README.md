This directory contains snapshots of the OpenFlights airport, airline and route databases
Please see [Data](http://openflights.org/data.html) for file format, licensing, and more.

Since these files are only snapshots of live data, **pull requests are not accepted**.
Please create an account on [OpenFlights.org](http://openflights.org) and submit your edit
using the airport editor, or [open an issue](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/issues)
if there is a systemic problem (eg. wrong timezone for an entire country).


THIS data folder is a copy from https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights
The openflight repo hasn't merged multiple data fixup PRs in many years, thus we now roll our own copy here.
Please not, that we still need a proper update process for all projects that use this gem if we adjust the data.
